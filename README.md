# NetflixHelper
This is my **first app created with Kotlin** for Android Slope -> Beginner exercise.

It's an application that let a user choose a movie to watch on Netflix.

Just tap on *Suggest me a movie* button to see a movie title.

You can **add** movie titles you like and you didn't watch, too.

There are **two distinct layout**, one for *portrait* and one for *landscape*.
